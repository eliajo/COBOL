what do I want to learn or understand better?

Like last week I want to understand scrum better. I also want to improve my ability to develop several parts of a program at once. This week I felt like I could not focus as much as I wanted
on one single task sicne I had to help others. To do this I probably should slow down a bit and try to not take to many tasks at once.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I helped parts of the team find bugs and understand some key concepts in Android. I also spent some of that time pair programming. I felt like it made our development more effective and this
is something I think should continue. I also had some discussions about code quality with some members of the group. So generally just beimg around to help team members is
my plan to continue this.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have done some code review like usual. I also created some tasks. I have also spent some time reminding everyone of the roles we had when some discussions sprung up.
This was due to some discussion between PO and team members about priorities. I tried to make sure that the team knows that PO decides at the end of the day. 
I think I am comfortable with my contribution at the moment so nothing is really going to change. 


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I worked a little with the save system, mostly impementation decisions. I also worked on the notification system and the graphs. 
I feel like my productivity is better than last week but I wish I could spent more time on one single thing. I think this hurt my productivity. To remedy this I plan to
see if I can share some knowledge about the code I have written with the rest of the group.
