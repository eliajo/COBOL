what do I want to learn or understand better?
I have very bad confidence when it comes to IT, 
which I would like to improve by learning how to do stuff on my own. 
I will do this by testing and asking a lot of questions to the 
others in my group and just not give up when something doesn’t work. 
I want to learn more about the API’s that can be useful aswell.  

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe that if you have an open communication and are not afraid to 
ask questions you can teach eachother a lot but also learn a lot from 
eachother. I can provide some insight in project management and pass on 
what we have studied in previous courses. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I can sometimes become stressed or impatient when i feel 
like a project isnt moving forward. Therefore i feel like 
I can add som effectiveness in the sprints.  

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I feel like I have contributed with ideas 
and input on others ideas which has been helping to move the 
project forward.
