What do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week I have worked a lot with how to navigate between two pages through a button, which has not worked out perfectly. I want to learn more about how to solve this in a good way by reading more documentation and by trying different solutions out.
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I can help others by explaining what I am working on right now so they understand what is happening and can help me back with new ideas for how to solve different issues. 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 
We had some problems with communication and different goals and priorities in our group. I have tried to understand both sides by listening and then bringing this to the discussion about what is not working in our group. I think this made us understand each other better and developed our way of working into something that everyone feels a bit happier with.
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I have worked a lot with the contact page this week and finished the last parts of the mock-up. I also worked with the review of the last sprint and focused on how we can improve our communication. Further, I worked with the team reflection and actively participated in meetings where I focused on how to make them more effective and relevant for all attended persons.
