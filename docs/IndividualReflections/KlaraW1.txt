I want to learn how to develop an app together with my group. I also want to understand how to work with Scrum by practicing it and to become comfortable with working in Git. I will try to learn this by listening to my group members and ask them to explain things they understand and find out how to do things none of us can together.
Hopefully, I can help my group learn through my communication skills. I feel comfortable with reaching out to people in general, which can be an asset when we want to communicate with stakeholders or potential users of the app. Also, I hope that my interest in this subject and willingness to learn more can inspire and motivate the whole group.
My contribution towards the team´s use of Scrum is difficult to say since I haven´t used it before, but I guess my skills in reflecting and analyzing produced work and coming up with ideas for how to improve can be useful.
My contribution towards the team’s deliveries was this week to take an active part in the writing of the social contract and through discussions with the group, finding out what we wanted to include in it.
