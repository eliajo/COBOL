What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to develop an Android application and how to implement the views together with functionality from our mockup. I want to learn more about schizophrenia to be able to make a user-friendly UI for the patients and to ask the right questions to give the right material for the doctors to better help the patients. 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When I learn something new or realize that I know something that someone else does not, I can offer my time and help to explain it in the best way I can. Also, I can search for knowledge that is new for all and try to explain it for the group. 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Being a good team player. I hope to be able to contribute with more things later on in the project, right now, I find that some of the IT-students contribute with a lot of useful tools and knowledge that is really valuable for the whole group.
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I attended to the exercise and the lectures and have been working with the business model, the description, and the mockup together with the group. Also, we had a meeting with our stakeholder that we all took part in.
